## Overview
This README explains the modifications made to the client file of the Subnautica Below Zero Multiplayer mod. The change allows users to access developer mode, enabling console commands in the game.

## Changes Made
The client file has been modified to ensure that the query for developer mode always returns `true`. This allows players to use console commands during gameplay, which can enhance the modding and debugging experience.

### Details of the Modification
